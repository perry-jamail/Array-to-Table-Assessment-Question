# Array-to-Table-Assessment-Question
This was my solution I came up for the Codility technical assessment question over turning an array of integers into a table format.

The question was something along the lines of: "Given an array of integers, A, and number of columns, K, print out each integer in A in a table format as structured like so:
+----+----+----+
|  32| 145|   3|
+----+----+----+
|4562|  90| 601|
+----+----+----+
Where the spacing in each cell is determined by the largest number and each number is aligned right within its cell."

I had 75 minutes to complete the assessment.
